The Country Flag Project is a simple responsiveb web page that showcases flags and names of some countries. 
Initially built using HTML and CSS, the project has now been completed by incorporating JavaScript to create the same design done earlier. 
The purpose of this project is to build my skills and knowledge on the DOM and loop in JS.
A search feature is currently being worked on so users can search for any country.
Any contribution to this project will be appreciated.
